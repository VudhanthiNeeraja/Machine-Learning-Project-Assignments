This project includes a series of reports and corresponding Python scripts that document and implement a comprehensive machine learning workflow. 
<br>
Project Assignment - 1: <br>
This assignment focuses on comparing decision tree classifiers created using two different criteria: entropy and Gini index. <br>
The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these classifiers on multiple datasets by plotting ROC curves and computing AUC values. <br>
The evaluation will be done using 10-fold cross-validation, and a parameter search will be conducted on the min_samples_leaf parameter using GridSearchCV with at least five different values. <br>
The entire process, including data loading, model training, and evaluation, is implemented in a self-contained Python program. <br>
The results, including ROC curves and AUC values, will be documented in a report along with a brief description of each dataset and a discussion of the findings. <br>
