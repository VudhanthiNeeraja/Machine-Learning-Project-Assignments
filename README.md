This project includes a series of reports and corresponding Python scripts that document and implement a comprehensive machine learning workflow. 
<br>
Project Assignment - 1: <br>
This assignment focuses on comparing decision tree classifiers created using two different criteria: entropy and Gini index. <br>
The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these classifiers on multiple datasets by plotting ROC curves and computing AUC values. <br>
The evaluation will be done using 10-fold cross-validation, and a parameter search will be conducted on the min_samples_leaf parameter using GridSearchCV with at least five different values. <br>
The entire process, including data loading, model training, and evaluation, is implemented in a self-contained Python program. <br>
The results, including ROC curves and AUC values, will be documented in a report along with a brief description of each dataset and a discussion of the findings. <br>
<br>
Project Assignment - 2: <br>
This assignment aims to compare the performance of different regression models using root mean square error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. The tasks are divided into two parts: <br>
<br>
Task 1: Compare the RMSE of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) regressors obtained using three different k values by plotting their learning curves from 10-fold cross-validation. A table will display the RMSE at the last point of the learning curves, representing the maximum training data. <br>
<br>
Task 2: Compare the RMSE of a tuned KNN regressor (with k parameter tuned using at least five values), a decision tree regressor (with min_samples_leaf parameter tuned using at least five values), and a linear regression model. Their learning curves will be plotted using 10-fold cross-validation, and the RMSE at the last point of the learning curves will be shown in a table. <br>

The assignment includes a self-contained Python program that loads the data, trains the models, performs cross-validation, plots learning curves, and calculates RMSE values. The results and discussion of both tasks will be documented in a report, providing insights into the models' performance and their comparison. <br>
